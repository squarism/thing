# Thing

I can't figure out how to get three things to work together.
I'd like for an example to exist.

* gb - Go build based project layout
* testing - Writing stuff without tests is easy at first.  You don't have to worry about example files (fixtures) and relative paths.
* viper - An arbitrary library but it impacts pathing and testing
